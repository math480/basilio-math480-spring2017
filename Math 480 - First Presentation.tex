\section*{Introduction}
Introduce my name and the topics that I'm speaking about:\\
a.	Why I'm a math major\\b.	What I love about math\\c.	What is math good for





\section*{Body}
Talk about why I'm a math major, what I love about math, and what math is good for:

\subsection*{Why I'm a Math Major}
i.	Wasn't a math major at first; civil engineering was my first choice\\ii.	Took 302 and 311 for my engineering requirements\\iii.	Then found out that a BA in Math requires only 5 more classes not including this class (Math 
480); added on math major\\iv.	Took 321 and started loving proofs


\subsection*{What I Love About Math}
i.	Math is about using axioms and definitions paired with logic to come up theorems\\ii.	Love learning about the why of math (e.g. why is a negative times a negative a positive number?)




\subsection*{What is Math Good For}
i.	Math is used for many different purposes; specifically, to be used in the real world and to explore more areas of mathematics	
	1.	Applied math uses math to model the real world
	
	2.	Pure math uses math to study abstract concepts\\ii.	Although, both are related:
	
	1.	Applied math comes from pure math
	
	2.	Pure math may one day be used in the real world





\section*{Conclusion}
Reiterate main points

a.	Wasn't planning to be a math major

b.	After taking more math classes, I found a love for finding out the why

c.	Math is good for the real world, whether it's pure or applied
